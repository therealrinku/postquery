## About The Project

postquery is minimalistic and experimental postgresql client. it's created mainly for me to learn rust and build GUI app with rust to see how blazing fast rust can be. 
My goal is to build something useful in the process, which could actually solve a real world problem like so many other experimental projects out there.
However there is definitely a possibility of this turning into next unicorn company.
